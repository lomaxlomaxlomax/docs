title: About Blink
---
BlinkOps is an AI-powered security automation platform that turns complex security, IT, and cloud workflows into fast, governed automations. What makes Blink special is its agent-based architecture, where purpose-built micro-agents safely execute tasks with full visibility, guardrails, and approvals. BlinkOps combines the flexibility of AI with the control of enterprise automationâ€”so teams can move faster, reduce manual toil, and measure impact across the entire security ecosystem.
