A concise glossary of foundational Blink terms for new users.

## ⚙️ Core Platform Concepts

**Workflow**: A visual sequence of steps that defines what your automation does and when it runs.  
**Trigger**: The event that starts a workflow, such as a webhook, schedule, or manual run.  
**Action**: A single task inside a workflow, like sending a Slack message or creating a ServiceNow ticket.  
**Connection**: A secure integration that stores credentials for third-party tools.  
**Variable**: A placeholder for dynamic data passed between workflow steps, for example `{{alert.id}}`.

## 🧠 AI and Agents

**Micro-Agent**: A small, purpose-built automation that runs independently with its own permissions and logic.  
**Builder Copilot**: Blink’s AI assistant that helps you design prompts, build workflow steps, and suggest next actions.

## 🧩 Execution and Data

**Runner**: A secure environment that executes actions in the cloud or within private infrastructure.  
**Table**: A lightweight database inside Blink used to store structured data such as assets, users, and alerts.  
**Pack**: A logical container that organizes related workflows, tables, and automations within a workspace.  
**Template**: A prebuilt workflow that can be cloned, customized, and reused as a starting point for new automations.

## 🧾 Case Management

**Case**: A record that tracks incidents, findings, or investigations within Blink’s Case Management module.  
**Alert**: A signal or event that indicates a potential issue, such as a failed login or detected vulnerability.  
**Observable**: A specific data element extracted from an alert or case, like an IP address, domain, or file hash.

## 📊 Platform Overview

**Dashboard**: A real-time view of automation performance, including workflow runs, errors, and adoption metrics.
